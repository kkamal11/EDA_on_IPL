  <h2 align="center">Indian Premium League: <b>Exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b></h2>
  <p align="center">A Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Python</p>
</center>

In this project, I have done exploratory data analysis on IPL matches where I have tried to answer a few questions and find some insights using the available data. The dataset that I have used in this notebook is IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Datasets sourced from [cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/). The dataset has information about IPL matches from 2008 to 2022.

The Python packages that I have used in this notebook are:
- **NumPy**: <i>For numerical computations</i>
- **Pandas**: <i>For data processing and file input/output</i>
- **Matplotlib**: <i>For data visualization</i>
- **Seaborn**: <i>For modern and statistical visualization</i>
